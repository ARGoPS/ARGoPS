# ARGoPS_work
Welcome to the GitHub page for the Astrodynamics Research Group of Penn State (ARGoPS). ARGoPS is a research lab associated with Penn State’s aerospace engineering department. Established in 2017, ARGoPS was formed to strengthen and exhibit the collaborative astrodynamics research environment that Penn State has to offer. Research areas include all of astrodynamics, such as orbital and attitude motion of spacecraft, interplanetary mission design, spacecraft domain awareness, orbit determination, and trajectory optimization. ARGoPS is home to two Labs:
1. Control and Analysis of Stochastic Systems (CASS)
                – Director: Puneet Singla
2. Computational Astrodynamics Research and Experiments (CARE)
                – Director: Roshan Eapen
 ARGoPS also hosts the Penn State University Dynamical Observatory (PSUDO), a 0.6m optical ground station in Animas, New Mexico.

The ARGoPS GitHub is in its infancy. We are hoping to publish some of our recent work and results soon.
